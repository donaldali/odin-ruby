# Building Blocks

A few 'intro to programming' problems in Ruby for The Odin Project's [Projects: Ruby Building Blocks](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/building-blocks).

* `#caesar_cipher` shifts the alphabets of a given string by a specified shift factor.

* `#stock_picker` picks, from an array of given stock prices, the best days to buy and sell.

* `#substrings` determines how many times each substring (in an array of substrings) appears in a word.

Each file may be run with `ruby <filename>.rb` e.g `ruby caesar_cipher.rb`
